In this task we add basic logic to the application, RDB and tests.

1. There are products and categories. They have "many-2-many relation"
2. Build REST API managment capabilities for this entities:
2.1 CRUD
2.2 Assign, un-assign products to categories.
2.3 Get "all products", "all categories", "all products for given category" information
2.4 Filters:
 - For all products (+ for products in category):
    a) price is in range
    b) the name contains some char sequence
2.5 Sorts:
    a) Categories: by name, product count
    b) Products: by name, price
* You are free to add pagination or any additional sort/filter logic

3. Application should have initial data
4. You could use any cloud hosted (managed) RDBS.
5. The available logic is covered with integration tests
5.1. For testing purposes should be used data generation mechanizm (each run - new data)
5.2. Tests cover API level
5.3. Tests should run within build pipeline and have UI report

Acceptaince criteria
- API documentation tool contains all new entrypoins with ability to call them directly
- All API covered with tests
- None credentials should be presented into git repoo.
